# Conway's Game of Life

![Screenshot](https://github.com/tommygl2112/Conways_Game_of_Life/blob/master/cgol_screenshot.png)

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, populated and unpopulated. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

|0- Game Loop |   x   |   x   |   x   |
|1- As a user, whenever I navigate to the website and see an empty grid with the option to let the user set up the initial configuration. |      |      |   x   |
|2- If the game is paused I can resume it |      |   x   |      |
|3- I can clear the board |      |   x   |      |
|4- I can click a 'Randomize' button that will generate an initial configuration for the game to play and this can only be done when the games has not started or is paused.|      |      |   x   |
|5- I can see the amount of generation has passed since the start of the game |   x   |      |      |
|6- I can click a button that would set the game back to the initial state (how the website initially loads in) |   x   |      |      |
